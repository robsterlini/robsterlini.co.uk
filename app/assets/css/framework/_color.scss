/**
 *
 * All color variables should start with the color- prefix, and should
 * be descriptive to the color. $color-primary-accent is better than
 * $color-primary, as it's easy to figure out exactly what the color
 * is from the variable name. Avoid using specific colours for variables
 * as these may change significantly during the build and $color-primary-red
 * may no longer be red, but instead blue.
