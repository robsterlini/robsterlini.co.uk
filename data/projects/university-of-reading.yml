  - 'After graduating, I joined the Digital Development department at the University as the sole Digital Designer. During my year working there, I redesigned and built a new core-style which – although parts have been lost to a university-wide rebrand – can still be seen on <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/literature-and-languages/sll-home.aspx">some school pages</a>, <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/">the news pages</a>, and the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/library/">library page</a>.'
