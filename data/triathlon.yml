        complete:
            -   "This was easier than I’d thought. Only found myself missing coffee a few times, and everything else was simple to cut out. Counting what I would have drunk proved to be trickier though, so at the end I decided to go for a round £5 per day rather than a Diet Coke here, a Starbucks there."

        complete:
            -   "2 May was one of the best days of my life, albeit also one of the hardest. The elation as I came through the final obstacle, combined with the sense of achievement after every hurdle was unbelievable. I’d summoned up every ounce of my strength, and pushed through!"
            -   "It also came on the morning that I passed £500 in donations to my fundraising effort, which was also pretty damn overwhelming!"

            -   "It was never going to be my fastest 5km, but it helped me remember that enjoying these events is just as important as destroying my personal bests."

            -   "It didn’t come without drama though; I had a pretty tasty fall in the first one, spilling at 42kph on the bike on a rainy corner – that wasn’t enough to stop me though, and it made setting a second PB on the afternoon race even easier!"
