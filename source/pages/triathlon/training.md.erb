## Training

Entering a brand new sport from a somewhat unhealthy lifestyle was always going to be a tough ask, but I’m now at the stage where I can comfortably run long distances (and look to push out at least one of those a week). I can ride my bike for hours on end, and genuinely enjoy the fear of diving into the murky waters of the reservoir.

I’m not on some crazy training plan (although for the Olympic distance triathlon, and marathon in 2015 I probably ought to be), so it’s pretty much just run, bike, and swim as much as possible whilst listening to my body’s warning lights.

Simple.
