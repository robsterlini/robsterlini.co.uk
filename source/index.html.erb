      <h2>Frontend Developer</h2>
      <p>By day I’m a front end developer at <a href="https://fueled.com/sterlini" target="_blank">Fueled</a>; by night a designer, a runner, a triathlete, and&nbsp;more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <p>At Fueled I’ve created sites for global business, tech startups, established brands, and the like. It has also afforded me the opportunity to push the boundaries of the web, with imaginative case studies, and boundless capabilities.</p>
      <p>As a freelance developer and in past jobs, I’ve had the great pleasure of working with friends to create stunning pieces like kickpush.co. Reimagining the University of Reading site was pretty special given my fond love for my time there!</p>
