New stuff is (really) scary.

Next week I kick off my new job at [Fueled](http://fueled.com "Visit our website") and I’m giddy with excitement, but this is the most nervous I’ve been in quite some time. The biggest fear, certainly for me, is always “will I be good enough?”. Now, I’d like to think that I’m in a position to be starting because they reckon so, but I can be irrational right?

The past few weeks has seen me go from Sass-less (pun kind of intended) to smashing at keys in the command line. It’s really terrifying! I still have no idea what I’m doing, but [it’s working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXwGVXD7qEQ "Everyone loves a Star Wars reference, right?").

Having read [Jake](http://jakegiltsoff.co.uk "See Jake’s site")’s [advice to a design graduate](http://jakegiltsoff.co.uk/posts/advice-to-a-design-graduate "Read the full post on his blog") it made me realise that I have no idea where the last year went, but it also helped me see that I’ve already done a fair bit of scary stuff this year.

He also makes some great points about asking for help. Before I properly started interacting with the awesome guys and girls in this industry I found it difficult to admit I needed a helping hand and, sometimes to my detriment, I’d just go it alone (which almost never\* worked). So I started asking, and people started answering; hell, no-one knew what they were doing when they started so most people have jumped at the opportunity to pass on knowledge.

\*read *never ever*.

None of this new stuff will ever get any less scary; all I can do is better set myself to embrace it, and let it push me outside of my comfort zone.

And if that fails, I’ll become a loaf instead.
