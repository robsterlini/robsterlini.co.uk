For a long time we’ve used Twitter as a platform for discussion, but 140 characters can really stifle (and spam) a conversation in a way that it wasn’t designed to be used.

Slack changed the way we communicate at Fueled; and I’ve recently joined a few localised Slack teams, and it got me thinking. So I put the idea to Twitter and we came up with (after some pretty terrible and amazing name ideas) [Design and shit](https://designandshit.slack.com/ "Join our discussion").

It’s open to anyone – designers, developers, illustrators, none of the above – so [get in touch](/contact/ "Reach out through email or on Twitter") if you want to join in discussions about:

- \#designandshit;
- \#devandshit;
- \#musicandshit;
- \#sportsandshit;
- and basically anything else you want to chat about (and shit).

Eventually I’ll set up some kind of automated invite service, but until then, this’ll have to do.

*We only have one rule at the moment, and that’s ‘Don’t be a dick’. If you’re a dick then you’ll quickly find yourself dumped on your arse outside the Slack team. Boom!*
