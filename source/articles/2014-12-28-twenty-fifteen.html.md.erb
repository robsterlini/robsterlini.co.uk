## A year on

2014 has been an adventure. I [left Reading](/journal/good-bye-reading "Read about my moving back to London"), moved back to London, and [started at Fueled](/journal/three-months-at-fueled "Read about my first three months at Fueled"). I went skiing with my dad – a first-timer on the slopes. I went to Queen Liz’s Garden Party. I watched my mum run a marathon. All in all, it’s been a pretty great year!

But what about those promises I made to myself? A year ago I [made some resolutions for 2014](/journal/resolutions "Read back on last year’s resolutions"), and reading back through them now I’ve kept some, fallen short on others:

### Fitness

This has been my biggest push this year, it started well, peaked, and it wasn’t until I got back to London that I realised I’d let it slip. Since then it’s been all uphill (and if you follow me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/robsterlini "Follow me on Instagram") or Snapchat then you’ll have seen any number of gym selfies and progress shots). I’m hoping to push on next year and continue with the hard work.

I’ve signed up for the London Triathlon in August 2015, and I’m [raising money](http://sterli.nl/robs-triathlon "I’d love it if you donated towards Macmillan") for Macmillan in the process. There are a few other events that I want to compete/complete, but I’ll update my Virgin Money Giving page as and when they’re confirmed.

### Health

The food diary was fun, but time consuming. It’s much easier just to stop lying to yourself about what you’re eating, eat clean where you can and treat yourself in moderation.

### Personal habits

Nailed the biting habit (sorry, not sorry for the pun), but failed on the language on Twitter front – maybe I’m just not cut out for being 100% clean on there.

### Reading etc

I’ve picked up reading on the commute and enjoying it; and I think it’s helped with the blog posts I’ve written over the last 12 months.

If you have any book suggestions just hit me up [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/robsterlini), I’d love to have some variety in my reading!

## Twenty-fifteen

2015, eh? I’m twenty-three now and people keep telling me I should enjoy being young so instead of setting out two or three resolutions, I’ve decided to create bucket list; and for every month I don’t complete one I’ll add another. I’ve got twelve here so far, and if I get to the end of them I’ll add some more!

1. Complete a triathlon
2. Run a marathon
3. Jump out of a plane
4. Learn to ski backwards properly
5. Get a pug
6. Speak at a conference
7. Design a *complete* typeface
8. Pan-American road trip
9. Go vegetarian for a month
10. Climb a mountain
11. Go on a Safari
12. Complete an Iron Man

Wish me luck!

## My only resolution

I lied when I said I had no resolutions. My only resolution is to constantly remind myself just how lucky, and privileged I am (and my family is), and not to take stuff for granted. Bit heavy that one, especially for me, but I think it’s an important one!
