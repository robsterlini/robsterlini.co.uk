## Why?

I talked a bit about eating more healthily, and doing more exercise in my [post about resolutions](/posts/resolutions), but I only touched upon it very lightly, and didn't look at why I was doing it.

When I was younger I did sport twice a week as part of the PE curriculum; and loved it. I played for my school football team on a Saturday morning, having trained on the Tuesday, and sometimes the Thursday; and loved it. I played basketball – not that well, I'm 5'9" for goodness sake; but I loved it. They all have one thing in common: *loved* it. I don't do any of them any more. For a while I played for the St. George's Hall FC, but that was more of a social event. I've frequented a few different gyms, but never found the motivation to go as often as is necessary to see drastic effects (and plus I was always a bit intimidated by the more regular gym users, and their tangible testosterone that followed them around the free weights). My family are big runners, my mother runs several times a week and is gearing towards championing her half-marathon successes with a full marathon this coming spring, my brother runs several times a week, and mixes that with rowing whilst at Cambridge. I've got a great pair of running shoes from [Sweatshop](http://sweatshop.co.uk), but I don't use them enough.

Regardless, whichever excuses or reasons I give, I don't exercise often enough anymore.

That has to change.

And it is. But it's easy to say it and not do it, so I'm trying a different tact. Blogging, and recording every bit of it. The exercise, the food I eat, and my progress in pictures. That last one was the trickiest to convince myself to do, but I figured that however bad I look now, that can be the motivation to push on and improve it.

So here they are: the [food diary](/posts/food-diary), and the [exercise diary](/posts/exercise-diary). They're separate pages because 365 days down the line, they're going to be long posts. I'll be keeping this one updated with progress more generally, so don't feel the need to constantly check up on how their going.

*Here's a little disclaimer. This isn't for anyone else, it's for me. By putting it in the public domain, it's a way to trick myself into pushing harder, running further, and eating more healthily. If you want to read it, then I'm honoured. If you want to chat about it [drop me a tweet](http://twitter.com/robsterlini). If you want to laugh at me about it, go ahead, but don't darken my doorway to do it.*
