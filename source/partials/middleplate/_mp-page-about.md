## What is Middleplate?

{{section_mid}}

[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com "Find out more about Middleman") is this bloody brilliant ruby framework that allows you to create lightning fast, super maintainable, static websites.

If you’re a ruby expert, or a regular Middleman user then this serves as a springboard for each project – with a basic set of styling partials, and blogging set up so you don’t have to remember how those settings work.

Or if you’re a Middleman virgin, then this is a great starting point as it comes with a bit of extra documentation and some examples of specifically how to set some bits up.

Why not [give it a download](documentation#installation "Find out about installing Middleplate") and see if it’s something you can weave into your workflow.
